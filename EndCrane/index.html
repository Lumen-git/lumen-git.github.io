<b>Subject:</b> End the Crane Partnership

<b>Body:</b> To whom it may concern,

I am writing to you today as a concerned member of the Indiana University community. For the past three days, the israeli army has been bombing refugee tents in Rafah, Palestine. This bombing campaign has caused babies to be decapitated, entire families to be burned alive, and extreme destruction to an already devastated area. This act of violence comes after the International Court of Justice ordered israel to stop attacking Rafah. As an IU community member, I am particularly distraught that this university is funding this genocide of the Palestinian people. I demand that IU end itâ€™s partnerships with the naval base Crane, which helped transport the 2,000 pound bombs israel just dropped on tents and families. Crane has spent the past eight months of genocide supplying weapons to the state killing thousands upon thousands of innocent Palestinians. Further, Crane is involved in the development of AI weaponry that streamlines this killing machine. Crane also houses white phosphorus, an illegal chemical weapon that israel has used repeatedly on the families and children of Palestine. It is disgusting that Indiana University has so many academic, research and development, and recruitment partnerships with NSA Crane. These partnerships must end. Indiana University must acknowledge the ongoing genocide against Palestine, and end its institutional complicity.

In solidarity with the Palestinian people.</pre>
