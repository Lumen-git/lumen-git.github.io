This too shall pass.
Today, of all days, see how the most dangerous thing is to love.
I'll always struggle to think of you in a harsh way. I know that's weird but I still see you for the human beneath.
Love in, love out. Hating you doesn't mean I love myself now.

Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!
Feel your breath course frankly below, and see life as a worthy opponent.
Tell the panic it can wait, even though inside my brain it feels like doomsday.
That's life. That's what all the people say. You're riding high in April, shot down in May.
