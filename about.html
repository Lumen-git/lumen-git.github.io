    <p class="aboutheaders">How it began</p>
    <p class="abouttext">Legend has it that sometime in 4th grade I found a video on YouTube about making scrolling green "Matrix" text using nothing but notepad. Couldn't do it. At the time, programming (and file extensions) were beyond me. A year later in 5th grade, I found that same video, and noticed that a key part of the project was saving the file as something called a .bat file. I tried it again and this time it worked! Suddenly I was watching every video on batch programming I could find, making simple Windows tool and collecting everything I learned in a pseudo-OS I called "HubOS". From there, learning was slow. Toying around with an Arduino, getting a Raspberry Pi but not knowing what to do with it, being daunted by "real" programming languages. It wasn't until Sophomore year of high school where I picked up a book about Python and read it , page by page, on a two hour plane ride. Everything clicked. After that trip I was writing Python scripts, and hungry to learn more. Every since then I've been incredibly passionate about computer silence, <span title="Just like Dr. Sam Beckett">leaping from project to project and lesson to lesson</span>. And I intend to keep up the pace until my hands can physically no longer type. I've used technology ranging from cutting edge VR headsets, super slow Commodore 64s, super fast supercomputers, experimental biological RFID/NCF implants, to the classic, never-lets-you-down Python IDLE.</p>

    <p class="aboutheaders">College and Work</p>
    <p class="abouttext">Currently I'm studying at Indiana University Bloomington for a major in Computer Science (focus in "Foundations") and a minor in Chemistry. In addition to studying "properly" in college, I informally study many other subjects on my own. Such topics include quantum computing, quantum physics, pharmacology, historical alchemy (the previous two motivating my chemistry minor), game design, and mathematics.</p>
    <p class="abouttext">While at college, I worked in IU's Luddy Maker Spaces. My main jobs included helping students use 3D printers, laser cutters, vinyl cutters, and maintaining all the machinery. Doing so gave a chance to work with some really great people, as well as explore the more physically creative and engineering sides of technology.</p>

    <p class="aboutheaders">Skills</p>
    <p class="abouttext">Currently, I'm most fluent in Python, Java, and Arduino, with JavaScript and C on the horizon (and BASIC, but unless someone needs backwards compatibility running back to the 80's I doubt that'll be helpful anytime soon). Working in a maker space has also made me quite skilled at Photoshop, Illustrator, SLA and FDM 3D printing, and laser cutting. While I know enough CSS and HTML to make a basic site like this (maybe a little more advanced should I choose to), I don't consider myself particularly skilled at nor fond of web design. Having my Computer Science studies focus in foundations, I'm used to working with many different computing concepts, from machine learning, evolution algorithms, software development, cyber security, data management, and many more topic branching out to all fields and areas of study. A few of my favorite concepts to explore are methods of computing pi and prime numbers, cellular automata, and higher dimensional math.</p>

    <p class="aboutheaders">A few fun facts</p>
    <ul class="abouttext">
        <li>I have code in the Arctic World Archive thanks to <a href="https://archiveprogram.github.com/" style="font-weight: bold;">GitHub's 2020 Archive Program</a></li>
        <li>In my left hand between my index finger and thumb, I have a microchip that allows me to communicate with tech using RFID and NFC communication protocols</li>
        <li>I'll debate with anyone that the 1993 Doom is one of the greatest games ever released</li>
        <li>A neurological quark called Synesthesia causes my senses of hearing and seeing to be linked, making sounds have visual representations in my head</li>
        <li>I have exactly 0 preference over Windows, Mac, or Linux. Give me any and the tools to run it and I'll be happy</li>
    </ul>
