    <div style="display:flex;">
    <p class="abouttext" style="float: left;"><span id="randomize"></span> They're currently majoring in computer science and minoring in chemistry at Indiana University, was well as studying historical alchemy, botany, and "clandestine pharmacology" (illegal drugs) outside of uni. Their work in CS started in 5th grade when they saw a video on YouTube on how to make green "Matrix" text using batch. Since then, they've grown to love CS, ranging from VR headsets to Commodore 64s. Although a lover of code, they're often drawn to creative coding, story telling, and writing, occasionally making a game or two. While at IU, they work in the Luddy Makerspaces, maintaining 3D printers, laser cutters, and other crafty gadgets.</p>
