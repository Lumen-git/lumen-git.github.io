    <p class="abouttext">Hi! I'm Aidan, but I often go by <i>lumen</i> online. I'm a <b>computer scientist</b>, <b>chemist</b>, and <b>researcher</b> from school and a <b>botanist</b> and <b>artist</b> by having too much free time and reading too many books and research papers. At Indiana University, I'm currently majoring in CS and minoring in chemistry, while studying historical alchemy, botany, and "clandestine pharmacology" (illegal drugs) outside of uni. My work in CS started when 5th grade me saw a video on YouTube on how to make green "Matrix" text using batch. Since then, I've grown to love CS, ranging from VR headsets to Commodore 64s. Although I love all code, I'm often drawn to creative coding and story telling, occasionally making a game or two. While at IU, I work in the Luddy Makerspaces, maintaining 3D printers, laser cutters, and other crafty gadgets.</p>
