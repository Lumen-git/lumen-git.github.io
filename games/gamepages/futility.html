    <p class="text">Special thanks to <b>Aaron Reed</b> and his book <i>50 Years Of Text Games</i> for making me love text games, <b>Frank Lantz</b> & <i>Universal Paperclips</i> for showing me a few GUI elements are all you need for a great game (and teaching me JavaScript), and <b>Davey Wreden</b> & <i>The Beginner's Guide</i> for making me fall in love with narrative games. Also thanks to the songwriters and poets below who's words inspired parts of the story.</p>
