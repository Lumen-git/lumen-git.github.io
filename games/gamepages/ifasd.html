    <p class="text">Created October 4th to (around) November 12th as the final project for Indiana University's CSCI-C 292 Intro to Game Programming class.</p>

    <p class="text">Invader From Another (Spatial) Dimension is a twin stick, arcade style shooter where you play as a 2D character lost in a 3D maze. Being a project created from learning, many different systems, styles, and ideas are stuck together to create IFASD, leading to different areas and secrets hidden about.</p>

    <p class="text"><b>How to play:</b> WASD to move, arrow keys to shoot. Red enemies (attackers) can have 1-10 health, indicated by how intense their red color is. Green enemies (sprinters) have varying speed indicated by how intense their green color is. Killing enemies can drop 3 different power-ups. The + power-up (glows green) heals the player. The yellow start power-up increases the player's health (max of 3 for a total of 6 health). The purple star power-up increases the player's damage (again, max of 3).</p>
