let’s start with a simple warm up problem: what is a thing? Like a
physical object. What is it really? At the lowest level, a thing is a
bunch of atoms in some kind of order. In a series of defined
structures and patters, we go from atoms, to molecules, to bulk
substances, finally to things, give or take a few steps. Take my Mac
for example. Silicon, boron, and antimony atoms make up a crystal
lattice called doped silicon, which makes up a few billion
transistors. These transistors make up a microchip. Take a few of
those and some other components and you get a circuit board. Add some
peripherals, a metal case, and a battery and you got a laptop.

I hear you say, “How can you call a laptop useless, especially as a
computer scientist!?” Fine. A laptop is a terrible example of a
simple object because we already have another level of abstraction to
get to. The function of a computer is entirely dependent on it’s
software. The BIOS, operating system, drivers, and all those little
apps you have installed define the use of the machine<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote3anc" href="#sdfootnote3sym"><sup>3</sup></a>.
You can’t touch them, you can’t feel them or see them, but
without them, your computer is a super fancy rock. So this object in
front of you is not just defined by physical <i>stuff</i><span style="font-style: normal">,
but at some level there’s intangible </span><i>goop</i><span style="font-style: normal">
that defines what it is. The same applies to something like books.

Its
heavily simplified, but this is the general story of MacGyver. At the
weird quantum splitting event, labeled “quantum splitting bullshit”
on the graph, the story splits. But, no matter which laptop I pick as
the “true MacGyver,” it will have the exact same story pre-split.
Now we’re in a really weird state here. There can’t be two
MacGyvers, so one of these has to inherit the pre-split story and one
has to be severed off from the timeline to become it’s own object
with its own story (starting with the split). So how do we do this?
Hang on, there’s something bumping against my leg let me check it
out… oh its a cat. That’s strange. There’s a collar around its
neck. It has a tag on it that says “Property of Schrödinger.” I

Here’s
the graphified version of the original story. Theseus has his ship
which gets repaired over time. Eventually, the ship is all new and
somewhere in storage is a bunch of rotted wood. Ignoring the
impracticality of storing rotted wood, some magical alchemist comes
by and restores all the wood so its not rotting, and a ship is built
using the original material. This is assuming all of the bits of wood
that fell off in the ocean and digested by barnacles and lichen are
somehow gathered and put back in place, but that’s neither here nor
there because once we start getting into what ‘rot’ actually
means the whole story gets so much messier<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote7anc" href="#sdfootnote7sym"><sup>7</sup></a>.
We now have two ships, the repaired one and the restored one with
original material. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="left" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; background: transparent">
<font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This
graph is more complex than the spontaneous laptop situation, but
there’s a sort of continuity here that makes the problem easier.
Presumably, while the ship was undergoing repairs, Theseus was still
sailing it. A plank here and a board there doesn’t change the
continuity of the story. The ship which Theseus sails is the Ship of
Theseus. Even if the rot is removed and the ship is rebuilt with the
exact same materials, the branch of the story that made the Ship of
Theseus the Ship of Theseus was still ongoing. The Ship of Theseus is
not just some title, it is Theseus’ ship. The ship which he uses
and claims has his, by its very nature, must remain Theseus’ ship,
the ship that the story continues on.</font></font></p>

<font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	
So what becomes of that other ship? It becomes its own. It was born
of the Ship of Theseus, took on its own life, and now exist parallel
to the Ship of Theseus. It may be made of the atoms of the original
ship, but it is the original ship no longer, as it no longer shares
in the lineage of that story. </font></font>

<p align="left" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; background: transparent">
<font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Finally,
let’s look at the story a different way. Let’s say Theseus
stopped using the ship during the repairs. We went away to Rome or
whatever they did for vacation back then and when he came back there
were two ships, one repaired with new planks and one that had all the
rot and damage magically removed. Again, the true ship comes down to
whichever one he picks to be his ship. Both are repaired, one
classically with new materials and one magically by having the rot
removed. At this point, their history is the same. The one that
becomes the true Ship of Theseus is the one which Theseus chooses,
saying “This is my ship. It was repaired, but I will continue on my
travels in this one. The other is simply scrap.” </font></font>
